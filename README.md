# FitFuel Wellness Hub

FitFuel is a Streamlit application that combines an AI diet planner, a meal-level nutrition analyzer, hydration tracking, and a wellness calendar into a single workspace. It is purpose-built for Indian cuisine and uses the IFCT 2017 nutrient composition data plus OpenAI models for tailored meal planning.

## Key Features

- üß¨ **Profile-driven planning** ‚Äì Create a single personal profile (goals, dietary preferences, allergies) and reuse it across all tools.
- üç± **AI Diet Planner** ‚Äì Generate validated 7-day Indian meal plans with macro targets, allergen checks, and actionable warnings.
- üìä **Nutrition Analyzer** ‚Äì Stage meals ad‚Äëhoc and see macros/micros using the IFCT 2017 food database; ideal before or after eating.
- üíß **Hydration Coach** ‚Äì Compute recommended intake for the day and log actual consumption with a few clicks.
- üóìÔ∏è **Wellness Calendar** ‚Äì View plan adherence and hydration logs on an interactive calendar; achieved plan days glow green.
- üìà **Dashboard overview** ‚Äì Glance at today‚Äôs targets, queued meals, and hydration trends without digging into multiple tabs.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ (for local development)
- Docker & Docker Compose (optional)
- An OpenAI API key with access to GPT-4o-mini or similar model

## Installation

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

```bash
git clone <repository-url> diet
cd diet
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here" > .env
docker-compose up --build
```

Or using Docker directly:

```bash
docker build -t fitfuel .
docker run -p 8501:8501 --env-file .env fitfuel
```

### Option 2: Local Development

```bash
git clone <repository-url> diet
cd diet
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
streamlit run app.py
```

The app is available at http://localhost:8501.

## Application Tour

| Tab | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Dashboard** | Shows today‚Äôs plan targets, staged meals, hydration trend, and quick status cards. |
| **Profile** | Single source of truth for personal details, goals, allergies, and preferences. |
| **Diet Planner** | Uses the saved profile to generate a 7-day plan, complete with macros, warnings, and meal breakdowns. |
| **Nutrition Analyzer** | Evaluate any meal using quick picks or bulk paste; compare against IFCT macros. |
| **Hydration Coach** | Calculates daily target (based on weight, activity, climate) and logs actual intake. |
| **Wellness Calendar** | Interactive month view showing plan adherence (green cells) and hydration logs. |

### Diet Planner Workflow

1. Save or update personal details in the **Profile** tab.
2. Switch to **Diet Planner** and click **Generate 7-Day Plan**.
3. Review BMR/TDEE, per-day macros, warnings, and meal breakdowns.
4. Generated plans automatically populate the dashboard and calendar.

### Nutrition Analyzer Workflow

1. Go to **Nutrition Analyzer**.
2. Use quick high-protein picks or paste multiple foods in bulk.
3. Run **Analyze meal** to view macros, breakdown table, and AI parsing notes.
4. Download results as JSON for further tracking if needed.

### Hydration & Calendar

- Log water intake in **Hydration Coach**; logs sync to the calendar.
- Mark diet-plan days as achieved inside the calendar; completed days display with a green background.

## Data & Integrations

- **Diet planning** ‚Äì OpenAI GPT-4o-mini (or compatible) via the official SDK.
- **Food composition** ‚Äì IFCT 2017 dataset embedded locally (`archive/ifct2017_compositions.csv`).
- **State management** ‚Äì Streamlit session state retains profile, plan, hydration, and analyzer queues during a session.
